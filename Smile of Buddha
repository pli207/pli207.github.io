  <h2>Brief History of Ayuttaya</h2>
   <h3>Ayuttaya was founded in 1350 by King U Thong, who went there to escape a smallpox outbreak in Lop Buri and proclaimed it the capital of his kingdom, the Ayutthaya kingdom. Its population reached around 1 million around 1700, making it one of the world's largest cities at that time and was sometimes known as the "Venice of the East".
   In 1767, the city was destroyed by the Burmese army, resulting in the collapse of the kingdom. Nowadays, only the Prangs (towers) standing among the ruins remind people of the city's glories in the past.

  <h2>Our Experience</h2>
   <h3>Little time was left after I finished my summer internship in 2014. Therefore, the only available travel destinations for my wife and I are countries do not require a visa or can issue the visa on arrival for Chinese. Thailand became the no brianer option. Ayutttaya is 90 km north of Thailand. We chose to take the old train to go there. Really old trains: running at 40km/hr, stopping at time, no in-train broadcasting system... </h3>

   <h3>After two hours, we arrived in Ayuttaya and began our relax walk. The head of Buddha was in the ruins of old royal palace, embraced by the tree after being left in a hurry escape. When the sunset lighted up the buddha's face, you felt the tranquility in your heart.</h3>
